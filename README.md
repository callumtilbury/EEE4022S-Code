## Digital Audio Broadcasting Processing Chain for Passive Radar Applications

This repository contains the *MATLAB* code that was written for an undergraduate final-year project (EEE4022S) at the University of Cape Town. The aim of the project was to design a Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) processing chain for the context of Passive Radar.


### ./functions
This directory contains the core functionality of the designed DAB processing chain. An overview of the chain is shown below:
